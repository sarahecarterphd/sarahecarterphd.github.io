**Triving in today’s digital world as a sensitive human**

Technology can be helpful, but it has also made the world more overwhelming. **Louder. Faster.** We carry smartphones that buzz with notifications; we have instant access to news all over the world; and we have social media and messaging that doesn’t always offer the connectivity we crave. 

**For us sensitive humans, the world has always been a bit… much.** While all humans possess sensitivity to their environment - including emotions, sound, light, smell - some humans live life with the dial turned up. For these humans, digital technology adds yet another layer of noise to the mix.

**Purposely Digital helps sensitive humans thrive** in a digital age that is inherently overwhelming and overstimulating. This coaching approach, while not limited to topics explicitly concerning technology, **recognizes the added complication technology has on human lives.** It’s coaching that **empowers individuals to live a life according to their values** in the 21st century. Together, we explore your strategies to connect with oneself in a fast-paced, technology-infused world so that you can engage in a manner that serves your values, your goals, and your dreams.
