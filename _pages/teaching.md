My Teaching Philosophy
======

I am passionate about teaching the future generation of computer scientists and engineers about ethics. The technology of the future will be crafted by them, and the design choices they make will impact how ethical impact of future technologies. I remain heartened by the number of students, in classes and doing their theses with me, who show a genuine regard for ethics and wish to see more of it in their education. I think we are at an important point in CS education where the pedagogy is shifting to a more integrated form of ethics in CS education - not teaching ethics as a separate lecture of course, but as an integral part of each course and the entire study program. An example that inspires me is the [Embedded EthiCS program at Harvard](https://embeddedethics.seas.harvard.edu), which aims to do just this. 

We have a duty as educator to accomplish this in our own institutions - to shift our values from not only making sure students require the technical skillset to succeed, but the ability to think critically about ethics and successfully navigate wisely the tricky choices that may come their way in their careers. This deserves as much centering and attention as, say, developing programming or machine learning skills. 

In this vein, I tend to shy away from what I refer to as "checkbox ethics" - that is, ethics as a tick-boxing exercise that may only come up at the time a study undergoes ethical review. Instead, I view teaching ethics as 1.)  teaching them how to think critically like an ethicist, and 2.) cultivating empathy.

To the first, students must have some grasp of the basic schools of ethical thought (deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics) and have hands-on engagement with how each school of thought plays out in practice. I also encourage them to think about which theory or schools most resonate with them, and develop arguments for and against, in the context of real-world systems. I also encourage them to branch out and explore other schools of thought from these “big three” that may resonate with them.

The second is perhaps less traditional but can serve as a powerful means of helping students engage with the values, perspectives, and needs of the people who will eventually be using the systems they develop. As humans, we are literally hard-wired to be empathic, although it is an ability that we need to cultivate and fine-tune. Inspired by the work of social scientist [Karla McLaren](https://karlamclaren.com/), I’ve begun to play with how teaching empathy could be used in the classroom to help us consider the people who will be affected by the design choices we make. While verry much a work-in-progress, I’m excited to explore how traditionally marginalized “soft” skills like empathy might help the scientists of the future develop systems responsibly.  For more on this idea, please see the slides below (presented at the ICT.Open Conference, Utrecht, 2024).
