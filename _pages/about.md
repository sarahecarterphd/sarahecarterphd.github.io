Hello! My name is Sarah, and I'm **an ICF coach in training and former AI ethics researcher and teacher. I am passionate about ensuring that technology serves us** (and not the other way around). Itâ€™s my firm belief that all technology and innovation should be grounded in who we are and what we value. I have researched, educated, and now coach to make sure technology is helping each and every one of us live a life according to our values and goals. Welcome to my page, and feel free to reach out!

Today: Life Coach for Sensitive Humans
======

I am currently training to be an ICF-certified coach and found my own coaching buisiness - Purposely Digital. I aim to be a coach that supports sensitive humans to thrive in a digital age that is inherently overwhelming and overstimulating, empowering htem to live a life according to their values in the 21st century. Stay tuned!  

Formerly: Researcher and Teacher

Too often, we feel like technology has a hold of us, rather than using it to live the lives we value. During my time as a researchr, I explore **how we can design technology in a manner that empowers us** and puts us back in the driver's seat. In particular, I looked at how we can design systems to help us make more **value-centered decisions when interacting with technology**. To do this, I took insights from philosophy concerning human autonomy and translated them into design criteria, taking cues from other disciplines such as the psychology of decision-making, human-computer interaction, and value-sensitive design.

During my time in acadmeia, I was also lucky to have the opportunity to teach and supervise the engineers and scientists of the future. As an educator, I encouraged my students to emphatically consider the future people who will eventually be using the technology they will be building, including asking the tough questions: who is this technology for? Who is left out? Why is the technology being built? Are there other solutions? **If we want technology that serves us, we need empathic engineers and scientists that are attuned to and willing to anticipate our needs.** I aimed to serve others by nurturing the next generation of scientist, teaching ethics to scientists and engineers.
