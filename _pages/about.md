Hello! My name is Sarah, and I'm **a coach and AI ethics researcher. I am passionate about ensuring that technology serves us** (and not the other way around). Itâ€™s my firm belief that all technology and innovation should be grounded in who we are and what we value. I have researched, educated, and now coach to make sure technology is helping each and every one of us live a life according to our values and goals. Welcome to my page, and feel free to reach out!

Coaching: Empowering Sensitive Humans to Thrive in the Digital Age
======

As a coach, I focus on sensitive humans ([what is a "sensitive human?"](https://purposely-digital.com/faq-pd-sensitive-humans) and digital wellbeing. As a [sensitive human](https://purposely-digital.com/reclaiming-sensitive) myself, I aim to create a **safe and empathetic space** for clients to explore what is possible and find what makes them thrive. My coaching business, [Purposely Digital](https://purposely-digital.com), supports clients to thrive in a digital age that is inherently overwhelming and overstimulating. As a coach and with my company, **I empower fellow sensitive humans** to live a life according to their values in the overwhelming 21st century.

I am also currently moving towards formal accreditation by the [International Coaching Federation](https://coachingfederation.org). While coaches do not require certification to coach, **becoming ICF-accredited demonstrates a commitment** to ethical standards and a high quality of coaching. I plan to complete all the requirements by the end of 2025. 

Researcher: Value-Centered Decision Making
======

Too often, we feel like technology has a hold of us, rather than using it to live the lives we value. As a researcher. I explore **how we can design technology in a manner that empowers us** and puts us back in the driver's seat. In particular, I look at how we can design systems to help us make more **value-centered decisions when interacting with technology**. To do this, I take insights from philosophy concerning human autonomy and translate them into design criteria, taking cues from other disciplines such as the psychology of decision-making, human-computer interaction, and value-sensitive design.

While most of my time today is now spent coaching, I still have keep up to date and ocassionally publish in the AI ethics world. See more on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wZm0g4kAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=1) page. 


Teacher: Insiring Empathetic Engineers
======

During my time in acadmeia, I was lucky to have the opportunity to teach and supervise the engineers and scientists of the future. As an educator, I encouraged my students to emphatically consider the future people who will eventually be using the technology they will be building, including asking the tough questions: who is this technology for? Who is left out? Why is the technology being built? Are there other solutions? **If we want technology that serves us, we need empathic engineers and scientists that are attuned to and willing to anticipate our needs.** I aimed to serve others by nurturing the next generation of scientist, teaching ethics to scientists and engineers.
